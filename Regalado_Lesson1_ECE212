#Lesson 1

## Activity

1. *Why	do	you	think	uderstanding	computer	programs	is	relevant	in	our	time	today especially	in	the	new	normal?*

    * Because computer programs are the way to make application softwares which is useful for everyone in terms of business, education, employment, communication and media that needed to understand gradually to easily catch up the trends in digital world.
    
    
2. *If	you	were	able	to	learn	computer	program	what	program	will	you code?	Why?*

    * I will learn python programming language because this is popular in digital world and I think this computer program is a high level in programming aspects.
 
    
3. *What	would	be	your	primary	motivation	in	learning	programming?*

    * My motivation is my course that I am currently enrolled because phyton programming language helps us in the future and it is highly connected to the course.
    
    
## Application

1. *Why do you think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing?*

    * Because it specifies which line has the error immediately and it is a productive and user friendly language for all programmers compared C++ and Java which has more complexity than phyton language.
    
    
    
2. *If	Python	can	build	anything,	where	do	you	think	Python	is	not	applicable	for?*

    * It is not applicable  in building OS.
    

Exercise 1: Mailing Address (Solved, 9 Lines)

print("Complete Name: Jovito Miguel Regalado")
print("Complete Address: Arguelles Subddivision, Barangay San Fransisco, Panabo City, Davao del Norte 8105")
print("Course: Bachelor Science in Electronics Engineering - BSEcE")
print("School: University of Southeastern Philippines")

## Exercise 2: Area of Room (solved, 13 Lines)

Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once these values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the width will be entered as floating-point numbers. Include
units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with


#Compute the Area of the room
length = float(input("Enter the desired length of the room in ft/feet: "))
width = float(input("Enter the desired width of the room in ft/feet: "))

area = length * width

print("The area of the room is",area, "square-feet.")

## Exercise 3: Arithmetic (solve, 22 lines)

Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user. Your program should
compute and display:  

    •The sum of a and b  
    •The difference when b is subtracted from a  
    •The product of a and b  
    •The quotient when a is divided by b  
    •The remainder when a is divided by b  
    •The result of log10 a  
    •The result of log ab  
    
#The sum of a and b
print("Enter two integers you want to add")

a = float(input("Enter any integer: "))
b = float(input("Enter any integer: "))

sum = a + b

print("The sum of the two integers is", sum)


#The difference when b is subtracted from a
print("Enter two integers you want to subtract")

b = float(input("Enter any integer value for b: "))
a = float(input("Enter any integer value for a: "))

difference = b - a

print("The difference of b - a is", difference)

#The product of a and b
print("Enter two integers you want to multiply")

a = float(input("Enter any integer: "))
b = float(input("Enter any integer: "))

product = a * b

print("The product of the two integers is", product)

#The quotient when a is divided by b
print("Enter two integers you want to divide")

a = float(input("Enter any integer value for a: "))
b = float(input("Enter any integer value for b: "))

quotient = a/b

print("The quotient of a/b is", quotient)

#The remainder when a is divided by b
print("Enter two integers you want to divide and the remainder will be shown to you")

a = float(input("Enter your Dividend: "))
b = float(input("Enter your Divisor: "))

remainder = a % b

print("The remainder of the quotient is", remainder)

#The result of log10 a
print("Enter any integer that you want to solve for its logarithm")

a = float(input("Enter any integer for a: "))

import math

math.log10( a )

print("math.log10(a) is", math.log10(a))

#The result of log ab
print("Enter any integer for a and b")

a = float(input("integer a: "))
b = float(input("integer b: "))

import math
math.log10(a*b)

print("math.log10(a*b) is", math.log10(a*b))

## Exercise 4: Area and Volume (15 lines)

Write a program that begins by reading a radius, r, from the user. The program will continue by computing and displaying the area of a circle with radius r and the volume of a sphere with radius r. Use the pi constant in the math module in your
calculations.

print("Enter any radius")

import math
r = float(input("Enter any radius for r in meters: "))

area = math.pi * r * r 
volume = (4/3) * math.pi * r * r * r

print("The area of a circle with radius r is",area,"meter-squared")
print("The volume of a sphere with a radius r is", volume,"cubic meter")







# Lesson 2
## Introduction
This	chapter	introduces	several	basic	building	blocks	of	Python	programs:
  - literals,	like	numbers	and	character	strings
  - operators,	like + and *
  - function	calls,	which	take	values	as	inputs	and	compute	new	values
  - variables,	which	save	values	so	they	can	be	used	later	in	the	program
These	 are	 the	 basic	 building	 blocks	 that	 are	 assembled	 to	 create	 programs	 that	 you interact	 with	 everyday—from	 the	 software	 running	 on	 your	 smartwatch,	 to	 the infrastructure	behind	the	largest	websites,	and	every	app	running	on	your	phone.

## Application

Distance	Between	Two	Points	on	Earth (27	Lines)

The	surface	of	the	Earth	is	curved,	and	the	distance	between	degrees	of	longitude
varies	 with	 latitude.	 As	 a	 result,	 finding	 the	 distance	 between	 two	 points	 on	 the	
surface	of	the	Earth	is	more	complicated	than	simply	using	the	Pythagorean	theorem.
Let	(t1,	g1)	and	(t2,	g2)	be	the	latitude	and	longitude	of	two	points	on	the	Earth’s
surface.	The	distance	between	these	points,	following	the	surface	of	the	Earth,	in
kilometers	is:

distance	 = 6371.01 arccos(sin(t1) × sin(t2) + cos(t1) × cos(t2) × cos(g1 − g2))

The	value	6371.01	in	the	previous	equation	wasn’t	selected	at	random.	It	is	the
average	radius	of	the	Earth	in	kilometers

 import math
    #Function to calculate distnce
    def calcDistance(lat1,long1,lat2,long2):
     return  6371.01*math.acos(math.sin(lat1) *math.sin(lat2) +math.cos(lat1)*math.cos(lat2)*math.cos(long1-long2))
    #Function to convert degree to radian
    def convertRadians(val):
     return val*0.01745329252
    #Main function
    def main():
    #Prompt for latitude ang longitude of point1
        lattitude1=(float(input("Enter lattitude of point1: ")))
        longitude1=(float(input("Enter longitude of point1: ")))
    #Prompt for latitude ang longitude of point2
        lattitude2=(float(input("Enter lattitude of point2: ")))
        longitude2=(float(input("Enter longitude of point2: ")))
    #Get radian values
        lattitude1=convertRadians(lattitude1)
        longitude1=convertRadians(longitude1)
        lattitude2=convertRadians(lattitude2)
        longittude2=convertRadians(longitude2)
    #Display result
        print('Distance between two points = %.4f kms'%calcDistance(lattitude1,longitude1,lattitude2,longitude2))
    #program starts here
    if __name__=="__main__":
     main()
