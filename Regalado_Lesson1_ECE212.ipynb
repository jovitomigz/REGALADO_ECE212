At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and\nobjectives that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.\nWriting computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative problem\nsolving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about\nsolutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of\nlearning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Activity\n\n1. *Why\tdo\tyou\tthink\tuderstanding\tcomputer\tprograms\tis\trelevant\tin\tour\ttime\ttoday especially\tin\tthe\tnew\tnormal?*\n\n    * Because computer programs are the way to make application softwares which is useful for everyone in terms of business, education, employment, communication and media that needed to understand gradually to easily catch up the trends in digital world.\n    \n    \n2. *If\tyou\twere\table\tto\tlearn\tcomputer\tprogram\twhat\tprogram\twill\tyou code?\tWhy?*\n\n    * I will learn python programming language because this is popular in digital world and I think this computer program is a high level in programming aspects.\n \n    \n3. *What\twould\tbe\tyour\tprimary\tmotivation\tin\tlearning\tprogramming?*\n\n    * My motivation is my course that I am currently enrolled because phyton programming language helps us in the future and it is highly connected to the course.\n   "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Python Programming Language"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Python is one of the High-Level languages.
